Compiled binaries of linux 5.4 kernel with MultiPath TCP support. I couldn't find any builds for Raspberry Pi so decided to build one from source.

[MultiPath TCP](https://multipath-tcp.org) is an effort towards enabling the simultaneous use of several IP-addresses/interfaces by a modification of TCP that presents a regular TCP interface to applications, while in fact spreading data across several subflows. Benefits of this include better resource utilization, better throughput and smoother reaction to failures.
